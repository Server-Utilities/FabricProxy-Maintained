# FabricProxy (Maintained)

[FabricProxy](https://github.com/OKTW-Network/FabricProxy) is a 
Fabric mod that adds support for the forwarding of player data across a
Minecraft server proxy. These proxies can be Bungeecord (and forks) and / or
Velocity (and forks).

I, [Quaintified](https://github.com/Quaintified), intend on progressing this
mod in a continuous state throughout both Minecraft Snapshot-Season and
Released-Season.
